A skill for creating stunning, animation-rich HTML presentations — from scratch, by converting PowerPoint files, or by converting any existing HTML. Works with AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex).

## What This Does

**HTML Slides** helps non-designers create beautiful web presentations without knowing CSS or JavaScript.

> **Default mode: Pro (Obsidian)** — Just say "create a presentation about [topic]" and you get interactive components, charts, and polished animations out of the box. No mode selection needed.

It also offers a **Vibe mode** with 12 creative themes for non-technical presentations — say "create a vibe presentation" to use it.

### Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools, no frameworks.
- **Agent Skills Standard** — One install works across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI Codex.
- **Visual Style Discovery** — Can't articulate design preferences? Pick from generated visual previews.
- **Rich Component Library** — Flip cards, expandable cards, code blocks, architecture flows, stats cards, charts (via Chart.js), tables, timelines, and more.
- **PPT Conversion** — Convert existing PowerPoint files to web, preserving all images and content.
- **HTML Conversion** — Convert any HTML file (reveal.js, Marp, Google Slides exports, articles, generic pages) into HTMLSlides format.
- **Anti-AI-Slop** — Curated distinctive styles that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluedusk/html-slides/main/remote-install.sh | bash
```

This one command clones the repo, detects your agents, and sets up everything. **Run the same command again to update.**

### Install from cloned repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluedusk/html-slides.git
cd html-slides
./install.sh
```

Interactive installer with user-level vs project-level scope choice.

### Manual Install

Pick your agent(s) below. Replace `/path/to/html-slides` with the actual path to your cloned repo.

#### Claude Code

**Via plugin marketplace (recommended):**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add bluedusk/html-slides
claude plugin install html-slides
```

**Via skill symlink:**

```bash
# User-level (available in all projects)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides ~/.claude/skills/html-slides

# Project-level (available only in current project)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides .claude/skills/html-slides
```

#### Gemini CLI

```bash
# User-level (available in all projects)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides ~/.gemini/skills/html-slides

# Project-level (available only in current project)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides .gemini/skills/html-slides
```

#### GitHub Copilot

```bash
# Project-level only (Copilot reads .github/skills/)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides .github/skills/html-slides
```

#### OpenAI Codex

```bash
# User-level (available in all projects)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides ~/.codex/skills/html-slides

# Project-level (available only in current project)
ln -s /path/to/html-slides .codex/skills/html-slides
```

All agents also support the universal `~/.agents/skills/` path as defined by the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

### Updating

Re-run the install command to update:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluedusk/html-slides/main/remote-install.sh | bash
```

For Claude Code plugin specifically:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update html-slides
claude plugin update html-slides@html-slides
```

Restart your agent after updating.

## Two Modes

HTML Slides offers two modes. **Pro is the default** — if you don't specify a mode, you get the full interactive component system.

### Pro Mode (Default)

Structured interactive components with deterministic output. The AI maps your content to the right component type automatically. Multiple themes available — same components, different visual styles.

> "Create a presentation about [topic]"

or specify a theme:

> "Create a presentation about [topic] using the Excalidraw theme"

**Available themes:**

| Theme | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| Obsidian (default) | Dark background, blue/green/orange accents |
| Excalidraw Light | Hand-drawn, sketchy, whiteboard on white |
| Excalidraw Dark | Hand-drawn, sketchy, whiteboard on dark |
| Editorial Light | Luminous, editorial, tech-forward minimalism |
| Binary Architect | Hacker-elite, sharp corners, neon on void-black |

**Components included:**

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Title Slide | Opening with hero text and rainbow gradient |
| Statement | Bold centered text with glow |
| Flip Cards | 2x2 grid, click to reveal back side |
| VS/Comparison | Side-by-side with visual contrast |
| Architecture Flow | Connected boxes showing a pipeline |
| Code Block | Syntax-highlighted terminal window |
| Auth Flip Compare | Before/after with red/green flip cards |
| Stats Cards | Large animated numbers |
| Expandable Cards | Click to reveal hidden details |
| Status Timeline | Vertical list with colored status dots |
| Table | Styled data table with hover highlights |
| Chart | 8 chart types via Chart.js (bar, line, pie, doughnut, radar, polar, scatter, bubble) |
| CTA Box | Call-to-action with resource links |

Best for: technical talks, product demos, data-rich presentations, API overviews.

### Vibe Mode — Creative Themes

AI interprets your content freely with distinctive visual styles. No structured templates — the AI decides the best layout for your content.

> "Create a vibe presentation about [topic]"

The skill will:
1. Ask about your content (slides, messages, images)
2. Ask about the feeling you want (impressed? excited? calm?)
3. Generate 3 visual style previews to compare
4. Create the full presentation in your chosen style

**Available themes:**

| Category | Themes |
|----------|--------|
| Dark | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Creative Voltage, Dark Botanical |
| Light | Notebook Tabs, Pastel Geometry, Split Pastel, Vintage Editorial |
| Specialty | Neon Cyber, Terminal Green, Swiss Modern, Paper & Ink |

Best for: pitch decks, keynotes, non-technical presentations.

### Convert a PowerPoint

> "Convert my presentation.pptx to a web slideshow"

### Convert Any HTML

> "Convert my-page.html to a presentation"

Auto-detects the source format, extracts content, and generates a spec-compliant HTMLSlides file.

| Source Format | Detection |
|---------------|-----------|
| reveal.js | `<div class="reveal">` + `<section>` |
| Marp | `<!-- marp: true -->` or `class="marpit"` |
| impress.js | `<div id="impress">` + `div.step` |
| Slidev | `class="slidev-layout"` |
| Google Slides | Google-specific nested div structure |
| Article / Blog | `<article>`, `<main>`, or heading-structured HTML |
| Generic HTML | Falls back to heading-based splitting |

## Output

Every generated presentation produces a single file:

```
my-deck.html              ← self-contained: CSS, JS, and speaker notes all inline
```

### Speaker Notes

Speaker notes are embedded inside each slide as hidden JSON. Open the browser's DevTools (F12), detach to a separate window, and notes appear in the console as you navigate — a free presenter view.

```
📋 Slide 1: Introduction
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Welcome everyone. Today we'll look at how...

  • Pause after welcome
  • Gauge audience familiarity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 For a better presenter experience, try the HTML Slides app: htmlslides.com
```

To edit notes, ask your AI agent: `"Update the speaker notes for slide 3 to say..."`

## Architecture

| `assets/components.css` | Shared component CSS for all Pro themes | Phase 3 (Pro) |
| `assets/themes/*.css` | Theme CSS files (colors, fonts) | Phase 3 (Pro) |
| `assets/slides-runtime.js` | Navigation JS + Chart.js integration | Phase 3 (Pro) |
| `scripts/extract-pptx.py` | PPT content extraction | Phase 4 (PPT conversion) |
| `references/conversion-patterns.md` | Framework detection patterns | Phase 5 (HTML conversion) |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | Deploy to Vercel | Phase 7 (sharing) |
| `scripts/export-pdf.sh` | Export slides to PDF | Phase 7 (sharing) |

## Sharing Your Presentations

After creating a presentation, the skill offers two ways to share:

### Deploy to a Live URL

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh ./presentation.html
```

Deploys to a permanent, shareable URL via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free). Works on any device.

### Export to PDF

```bash
bash scripts/export-pdf.sh ./presentation.html
bash scripts/export-pdf.sh ./presentation.html --compact   # smaller file
```

Screenshots each slide and combines into a PDF. Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (auto-installs).

## Requirements

- Any agent supporting the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io)
- For PPT conversion: Python with `python-pptx` library
- For URL deployment: Node.js + Vercel account (free)
- For PDF export: Node.js (Playwright installs automatically)
